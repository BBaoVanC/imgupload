# imgupload

## Moving from GitHub to Gitea

**TL;DR: Please go to my Gitea instance instead of GitHub for anything related to imgupload. [https://git.bbaovanc.com/bbaovanc/imgupload](https://git.bbaovanc.com/bbaovanc/imgupload)**

This repository might not exist on GitHub in the future! Releases will not be released here in the future. Instead, they will be released on the repository on my Gitea instance, which you can find [here](https://git.bbaovanc.com/bbaovanc/imgupload). Issues and pull requests should also be created on Gitea. For now, commits will still be pushed to this repository, but that may change in the future.
